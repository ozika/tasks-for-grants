instr1,N,text,,"First, please carefully read the consent form and press submit if you agree."
instr4,Y,audio,,"Firstly, let me introduce myself, my name is Ekaterina Valeria Esmeralda Elisabeth. Just call me Evee. 
I will guide you through this game. Any time you miss something, just hit replay, otherwise let's get going, we have much to do! "
instr5,Y,audio,,"As you probably know, we are currently exploring ways to make other planets habitable. While we can bring some resources for space voyages with us, others we have to manufacture directly in deep space. 
Luckily, scientists have recently realized that we can combine our resources with high-speed particles to generate large amounts of energy. The problem is that we do not know how our ingredients interact with different space particles. 
"
instr6,Y,audio,,That's where you come in! Your task will be to learn how Earth-based mixtures interact with high-speed particles. 
instr7,Y,audio,Show resources and nebula,You will be experimenting with these six resources. During each experiment some of the resources will be added to the mixture using our spark-delivery system forming a small nebula.
instr8,Y,audio,,The nebula serves as an incubation zone for an incoming high-speed particle. Once the nebula is hit by a particle we will be able to measure the energy that is released and consumed. Look. 
instr8b,Y,audio,,The particle turned the nebula red. Let us measure the energy. 
instr8c,Y,audio,,"The star-shaped resource created a nebula which reacted with a red particle. It produced 80 megawatts of energy. That is great. However, sometimes the collisions lead to a loss of energy. "
instr8d,Y,audio,,"Now, the star shaped resource created a nebula which reacted with the blue particle. It lost us 80 megawatts of energy. That is not great. However, the point of the first phase is to learn which of our resources interact with the particles. We can later use this property to harness energy. "
instr9,Y,audio,off,"You see, there is a small issue. What I haven't told you yet is that we are currenty on the outskirs of the Solar system and we have very. very. limited amount of energy. If all our energy gets used up, we won't make it to our destination planet, or back to Earth. "
instr10,Y,audio,,Here is what you will du. In the first phase you will be observing how combinations of different resources interact with two types of high-energy particles. We need to learn which resources interact with the particles and which du not.  
instr11,Y,audio,after: sample trial starts - the outcome is within 20 points of the expectation,"During each experiment, a number of resources will be used to form the nebula. We then wait until it is hit by a particle. 
The particles change the color of the nebula, so that we know which particle we caught. While the particle is in the nebula you will estimate how much energy will it produce or consume. 
Try it now."
instr12,Y,audio,after: three sample trials which dont go too well ,Your prediction was pretty accurate. That is all that counts for now. Great job! Try a few more.
instr13,Y,audio,,No worries. The whole point of these experiments is to figure this out.
instr14,Y,audio,,Here is the real deal. How to put this. We can't carry all of the ingredients with us forward. We have six now but we need to get rid of some to be able to continue. You need to figure out which ones to drop. 
instr15,Y,audio,,"First, I have a little simulated environment for you. To practice. In this simulation only one of the ingredients interacts with the particles. Your task is to figure out which one. Are you ready? "
instr15b,Y,audio,,"Okay, let us get started. "
instr16,Y,audio,,"Last thing, let us put some music on. As you can tell by now I am a very fun person. This is my favourite. "
instr_1_1,Y,audio,,"Cool. Which ingredient do you think interacted with the particles to generrate or consume energy? In other words, which one should we carry forward with us? "
instr_1_2a,Y,audio,,"Yes, that is correct. Well done. In a real scenario we would just carry that one with us, and leave all the rest behind. Now, let us move to the real lab. You need to find which of the real ingredients to carry forward with us. Remember, we want to take those which interact with the particles, irrespective of whether they produce or destroy energy. You should also try to predict accurately how much energy is expected to be produced or consumed by each combination of ingredients and the space particle that hit them. "
instr_1_2b,N,audio,,"No, that one did not interact.  This one did. "
instr_1_2bb,N,audio,,"Every time it was used to form the nebula the particles generated or consumed energy. Therefore, it is relevant to carry it forward with us as we can later make it collide with the right particle. "
instr_1_2b2,Y,audio,,Do you want more practice? 
instr_1_2b3,Y,audio,,"Okay, let us move to the real lab. You need to find which ingredients to carry forward with us. You should also try to predict accurately how much energy is expected to be produced or consumed by each combination of ingredients and the space particle that hit them. "
instr_1_3,Y,audio,,Let us get started. I hope you like my choice of music. Enjoy this classic.
